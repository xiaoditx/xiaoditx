<summary><h3>About me<h3></summary>

### Study experience
I'm a new one in programing, but I have great desires that are out of proportion to my strength (This seems a bit unrealistic, doesn't it?).

In short, my programming learning process can be mainly divided into three stages：

- The first stage: I use the programming language named `E language` developed by a Chinese domestic companies in this stage. (it's the software that can <font color=red>coding </font>in `Chinese`,to be honest, the results of its work are <font color="red">not satisfactory</font>.)
  
- The second stage makes a rough learning of assembly language (unfortunately only learn mov, add, jmp these commands gave up).
  
- The third stage: just now, try to learn the Godot.
  

Therefore, it is not difficult for you to see that the fields I have involved are not enough to support me have any achievements, whether it is Chinese programming, or complex and obscure assembly language, they can even be said to contain my development, so I recently feel that I need to jump out of this overwhelming situation and begin to find a way——a own way of mine.

### My dream

In my heart, I have always had a dream of making my own operating system —— completely developed by myself, not dependent on any existing operating system, of course, I know that this is a difficult goal, so I told myself to stop thinking about it for a while, so I have the goal that I am now pursuing: developing an RPG game.

Of course, the new goal also presented me with new challenges, and I had to think about some problems: Music production, art learning, scene design, these things force me to learn more, but I am also looking for solutions, whether it is to AI, or entrust some friends, I will do my best to strive for my goal, at the same time, I will use this to exercise my hands-on ability.

### Something else

As you can see from the article above, I'm not good at English, so I am also strive for <font color=red>learning English</font>, also, I have great interest in learning mathematics, Especially the <font color=red>applied mathematics</font> involved in deep learning.
